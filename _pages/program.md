The official program for the **Symposium for Quantum AI (SQAI) 2026** is not yet available — but it’s in the works!

We’re building a dynamic and forward-looking lineup that will bring together leading minds from quantum computing, artificial intelligence, and beyond. Whether you're a researcher, developer, or just curious about the cutting edge, there's something for you.

### What to Expect:
- **Research Talks** on quantum machine learning, quantum optimization, and hybrid architectures
- **Invited Keynotes** from thought leaders in both academia and industry
- **Panel Discussions** on the future of QAI and ethical, social, and policy implications
- **Networking Sessions** to connect with peers and mentors in the field
- **Poster Sessions**, demos, and emerging startup showcases
