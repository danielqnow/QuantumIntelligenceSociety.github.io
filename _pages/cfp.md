## 🧠 What is Quantum AI?

**Quantum AI** is the emerging field at the intersection of **quantum computing** and **artificial intelligence**, where quantum algorithms and hardware are leveraged to enhance the way intelligent systems learn, reason, and process information.

Quantum AI explores:
- Optimization and search  
- Generative models and pattern recognition  
- Quantum-enhanced reinforcement learning  
- Cryptography and secure multi-agent coordination  
- AI for quantum control and error correction  

It is more than just a technical fusion—it is a reimagination of how intelligence and computation may co-evolve in the quantum era.
